# Project Name: Salary Calculator
   

## Duration: 2 Week Sprint


This project is a Salary Calculator application that allows users to input employee information, including first name, last name, employee ID, job title, and annual salary. It then calculates and displays the total monthly payroll cost. The application is designed to manage employees by adding employee data to a table, calculating the total monthly cost, and indicating when the monthly payroll exceeds a pre-defined budget. Users can also delete employees from the list, which removes them from the displayed table.

## Key Features

- Form to input employee details: first name, last name, employee ID, job title, and annual salary.
- Calculation and display of the total monthly payroll cost based on the entered annual salaries.
- Automatic visual indication when the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, using a red-highlighted warning in the footer.
- Option to remove employees from the list using a "Delete" button, which removes the corresponding row from the table.

## Technologies Used: 

- HTML: For the basic structure and form elements.
- CSS: For styling, responsive design, and budget-exceeding visual cues.
- JavaScript: For DOM manipulation, form validation, salary calculation, and event handling.
